Saito can be safely stored like any other token. What's important is to understand what network (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Saito Native) your token is on, and to backup the secret seed phrase for that wallet that holds the token.

Most available Saito is wrapped on the Ethereum network in the form of an ERC-20 token. For example, if you purchased from [Uniswap](https://org.saito.tech/saito-ido-guide/), you purchased Saito as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. If you purchase on an exchange like [Gate](https://www.gate.io/trade/SAITO_USDT), they will tell you what kind of network you're on.

Some Saito is being wrapped on other chains like Binance Smart Chain in the form of BEP-20 tokens, and new chains are wrapping Saito all the time. Each of those will have a different but similar process. Make sure you're backing up the seed phrase that controls those tokens and not trying to convert between token versions unless explicitly stated it's ok through a bridge (right now there aren't any, you'd have to sell one version and re-buy another).

When Saito enables token persistence, you can start converting tokens to the native Saito token through bridges that will be provided. Again, what's important is that you then backup your Saito wallet to ensure you'll continue to have access to your native Saito tokens.

Use general crypto best practices (hardware wallets and cold storage) and be sure to ask questions if you need help!
