Every network faces the same rough cost-structure on a per-byte basis because those limitations come from physics. If you want to push the boundaries, you have to increase your spending on network hardware (which Saito Consensus pays for).

Also, by implementing a pruning mechanism as a dynamic form of “rent,” where the free market decides how much space on chain costs instead of ETH developers, you have an incentive to grow the chain until you can’t grow anymore, or shrink it if costs are higher than income.

Importantly, Saito solves the "[scaleability trilemma](/faq/how-does-saito-solve-the-scaleability-trilemma)" other blockchains have. There is still a tradeoff between decentralization and scaleability, but not by trading security.
