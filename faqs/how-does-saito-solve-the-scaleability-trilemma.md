As proposed by Vitalik Buterin, the scalability trilemma asserts that it is impossible to increase decentralization, scale or security in a blockchain without decreasing at least one of the other two.![scaleability-trilemma](/scaleability-trilemma.png)

Saito shows that a blockchain can get its security from the division of funds across the routing network. This means scaleability can actually increase the cost-of-attack and decentralization.

There is still a scale-vs-decentralization dilemma, but that has nothing to do with security and thus nothing particularly interesting or meaningful to say about it.
