Tragedy of the commons is a collective action problem that lets private individuals depleat group resources. In blockchains it happens when people can pay once and put something on-chain foreverâ€”creating a long-term cost for other node runners.

Saito has a circular blockchain where old transactions must compete for new space. This makes it so that everyone pays market rates and nobody can pass costs onto others in the future.
