Yes, Saito is a layer-one blockchain that doesn't depend on any other blockchain to run.

Saito the token can be wrapped on other chains, like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain for ease of purchase, then converted to native Saito tokens (read [How do I store Saito?](/faq/how-do-i-store-saito)).

Also, Saito integrates with Polkadot and its parachains, and as a Web3 Foundation grant receipient, has a project to build a decentralized game engine for Web3. This framework sits on top of the Saito blockchain and provides an easy way for developers from other chains to integrate Saito into their Web3 dapp.
