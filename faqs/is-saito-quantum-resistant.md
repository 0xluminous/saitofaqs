Quantum computers can't game Saito's work function because owning a quantum machine doesn’t make it easier to convince someone to give you a transaction containing fees. This is the same reason Saito is ASIC-resistant.

Quantum computing doesn't obsolete traditional crypto anyway though — it may force an increase in key length though, which is one of the reasons it’s essential to pay for scale.
