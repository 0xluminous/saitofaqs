Saito's work function can't be gamed by quantum computers because owning a quantum machine doesn’t make it easier to convince someone to give you a transaction containing fees.

Quantum computing doesn't obsolete traditional crypto anyway though — it may force an increase in keylength though, which is one of the reasons it’s important to be able to pay for scale.
