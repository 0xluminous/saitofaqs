Saito specializes in being a large, scaleable, decentralized layer-one blockchain. Most chains become more centralized as they get bigger due to [The Scaleability Trilemma](/faq/how-does-saito-solve-the-scaleability-trilemma), but Saito solves it:

> Saito shows that a blockchain can get its security from the division of funds across the routing network. This means scaleability can actually increase the cost-of-attack and decentralization.

Because Saito can scale, it's able to [handle large volumes of data](/faq/how-does-saito-handle-terabytes-of-data-on-its-blockchain), enabling entirely new kinds of applications that can live on-chain for significantly cheaper than most other blockchains.

This enables typical web3 use-cases, and what Saito doesn't currently offer through a layer-one, can be handled through deep integration with other layer-two blockchains. Because Saito is interoperable with [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), it benefits from its entire ecosystem.
