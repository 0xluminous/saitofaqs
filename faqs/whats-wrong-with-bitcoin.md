The reason Bitcoin had the 3 forks (BTC, BCH, BSV) is because the stakeholders of the system (users, businesses and miners) were not properly incentivized.
So while Bitcoin did solve a complex collective action problem, it didn’t balance the incentives properly, and the system is ripping itself apart.
Solving this isn’t easy; every blockchain has this problem.
