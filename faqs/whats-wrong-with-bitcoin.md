The reason Bitcoin had the UASF and 3 forks is because the stakeholders of the system were not properly incentivized.
So while Bitcoin did solve a complex collective action problem, it didn’t balance the incentives properly and the system is ripping itself apart.
Solving this isn’t easy, every blockchain has this problem.
