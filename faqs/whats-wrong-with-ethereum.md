> “The job of miners is to secure the network via hashpower, not to provide network infrastructure.” — Vitalik Buterin.

[Infura](https://infura.io/) spends a lot of money providing access to the Ethereum network. Most blockchain developers consider this a good thing. As Vitalik Buterin has remarked, the job of miners is to mine, so having private companies step in to run infrastructure is a boon. 

This falls into the trap of treating outside markets as “consequence-free” ways to fund core infrastructure.

There are three major risks in this approach: monopolization, lost openness and cartelization—all three outcomes are negative and lead to failed decentralization.
