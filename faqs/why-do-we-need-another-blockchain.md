There are two market failures that affect every non-Saito blockchain: a [tragedy of the commons](/faq/how-does-saito-solve-the-tragedy-of-the-commons) problems that encourages blockchain bloat, and a free-rider problem that pushes up the cost of using the network. These problems get worse and worse as networks scale and costs rise. In order to have a truly-scalable public blockchain we need to fix these problems.
